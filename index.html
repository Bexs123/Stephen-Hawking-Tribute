    <h1>Plans For A Trip To Space</h1>
    <p>In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to
      space.</p>
    <p>Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted. On 26
      April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727-200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of
      Florida to experience weightlessness.</p>
    <p>At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commerical flights to
      space did not commence before his death</p>
